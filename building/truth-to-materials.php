							<p class="bold">24 Savile Row pushes traditional boundaries. Each of the 10,000 hand-crafted ceramic tiles that make up its façade is unique. The building presents a very different view in every weather, and every light.</p>
							<p>This is the architectural art of creating a building, where natural beauty is always visible.</p>

							<h2 class="orange">The Façade</h2>
							<p class="bold">Ceramic artist Kate Malone spent a year responding to the needs of the architect to define the glazes and unique recipes for the façade’s tiles.</p>
							<p>The precision of the work meant that if recipes were out by just one gram, the structure of the glaze would be compromised.
Temperamental in nature, the glazes can be affected by any element, from tap water to the heat of summer, and even transporting the tiles to storage. Glazes all have a shelf life and time constraint. Each production batch was carefully hand-weighed, sieved mixed, bucketed, labelled, and hand-tested.
Slow-fired at 1260 degrees, the molten glaze forms extraordinary crystals then cools, creating beautiful yet hardwearing ceramic tiles.</p>

							<h2 class="orange"><i>The</i> Tiles</h2>
							<p class="bold">Just as a diamond or a lump of coal, crystalline structures grow on the earth’s surface. I replicate those conditions and ingredients in my glaze recipes and firing conditions.</p>
							<p>The building’s black tiles grow electric blue crystals much like lichen. Some tiles will grow a blanket of them, some will grow hardly any, and each one is unique. To complement the black glaze we selected three white glazes; a calm, super and PWwhite to spread over the building’s façade.</p>
							<p>Colour has limited place in the built environment. It was the architect’s vision to use black and white. I wanted colour, but with views from five angles, choosing black and white was a very clever choice. Change occurs in the dark and the light, and the way these monochrome colours respond to light and weather represents the crucial nature of building projects.</p>
