				Born in Toronto, schooled in New York, and with their work and lives based between Milan and London, identical twins Dean and Dan Caten are bona fide ‘global citizens’. The pair launched their fashion label, Dsquared2, in 1992. Since then, they’ve dressed everyone from Rihanna, Kanye and Britney to Madonna. Dsquared2’s London flagship store spans two full floors of 24 Savile Row in a spectacular brand experience. What do fashion’s most ebullient twins make of their new home in the capital?

							<p class="bold">“We work in Milan and live in London, so we know the city well. We love the city, and its people are a constant influence for us. Our London flagship is our largest store, and a particularly special store for us.</h2>
							<p>The neighbourhood’s heritage of bespoke tailoring was a strong reason for us to base ourselves here. The store’s interior themes are forest and nature, motifs that are an integral part of our Canadian heritage. But it differs from the other flagship stores because it has a more contemporary atmosphere.</p>

							<p>For us, Savile Row represents both tradition and evolution. It has the link to the bespoke art, and some of the world’s most excellent tailors are here. Mayfair is a very exclusive and very central area, with its own unique identity. It has a charming atmosphere, but it’s also very international. It’s the perfect blend of a sophisticated atmosphere and the proper exposure. We really love eating at Cecconi’s or The Arts Club or just having tea at Claridge’s. Mayfair is related to evolution, the arts, culture and even business. It breathes exclusivity and modernity at the same time.</p>
							<p>We got into fashion when we were young, making clothes for our sisters. As time passed, our passion became stronger. We realised that we wanted to make something of our own and that fashion would be our business. We moved to New York to study; then to Italy where we had the opportunity to work with different brands.</p>

							<p>What we really wanted to do was create something that completely encompassed our style and vision. Dsquared2 reflects our personalities and lifestyle: fun, sexy, glamorous and irreverent. It’s accidental chic, uncontrived cool. Dsquared2 is not just fashion. It’s a specific attitude and mood.</p>
							<p>Since we began, Dsquared2 has gradually grown, and continued to step forward. Today, the brand is more mature and focused, and we feel like that too. Our collections reflect our evolution.</p>
